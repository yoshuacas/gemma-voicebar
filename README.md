# codewithvoice

**codewithvoice** replaces macOS built-in dictation with a menu-bar app that runs
entirely on-device: [mlx-whisper](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples) for
speech-to-text and [Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) for
text-to-speech, in one process. Apple's dictation types instantly but mishears
constantly; this types a couple of seconds behind your voice, and gets the words
right.

Because it types into whatever has focus, it works as **voice input for AI coding
tools** — talk your prompts into Claude Code, Cursor, aider, or any terminal or
editor. No subscription required (Claude Code's built-in `/voice` is gated to
Anthropic subscription plans), no audio sent anywhere.

## Key features

- **Push-to-talk dictation** — hold Right Option, speak, release; text lands at your cursor.
- **Live typing** — confirmed words are typed *while* you speak (LocalAgreement-2 over chunked whisper passes), with layered guards against whisper's silence-hallucination loops.
- **Speak-back** — ⌃⌥S reads the selected text aloud; 8 Kokoro voices.
- **Spoken Claude Code summaries** — a Stop hook speaks a one-sentence summary of every turn, so you hear what happened instead of reading walls of text. Works for any tool via `codewithvoice-speak` or the speak spool.
- **100% local** — audio never leaves the machine; models are ~500 MB (whisper-small-q4) + ~330 MB (Kokoro).
- **Clipboard-safe** — paste injection snapshots and restores clipboard contents, including rich types.
- **Single process** — no daemon, no HTTP; one `rumps` app owns hotkeys, mic, models, and injection.

## Quickstart

Requires Apple Silicon, macOS 14+, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoshuacas/codewithvoice.git
cd codewithvoice
make install
make espeak    # Kokoro fallback for uncommon words
make run       # first run downloads models (~850 MB), then ⏳ → ●
```

Grant **Microphone**, **Accessibility**, and **Input Monitoring** to your
terminal app when prompted, relaunch, then hold **Right Option** in any text
field and speak. Full walkthrough:
[Getting started](https://yoshuacas.github.io/codewithvoice/tutorials/getting-started/).

For the full voice loop with Claude Code — dictate your prompt, hear a spoken
summary of each response — add the
[Stop hook](https://yoshuacas.github.io/codewithvoice/guide/claude-code-voice/)
(one settings.json entry, ~2 minutes).
