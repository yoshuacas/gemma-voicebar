# codewithvoice — Agent Guide

## Repository scope

- **What this is**: a single-process macOS menu-bar dictation app (mlx-whisper ASR + Kokoro TTS).
- **What this is not**: a client/server system. A FastAPI daemon existed and was deliberately deleted (2026-05-18) — do NOT reintroduce a daemon, HTTP API, or LaunchAgent. A Gemma-4 demo suite also lived here and was removed (2026-06-11); Gemma is not a dependency.
- **Primary language**: Python 3.12. **Package manager**: `uv`.
- **Platform**: macOS / Apple Silicon only (pyobjc, rumps, MLX).

## Layout

```text
src/voicebar/
├── app.py        — rumps app, menu, PTT + speak flows
├── engine/       — asr.py (whisper + hallucination filter), tts.py (Kokoro)
├── streaming.py  — StreamingTranscriber: LocalAgreement-2 live typing
├── recorder.py   — mic capture (16 kHz mono, 29.5 s cap, snapshot())
├── hotkeys.py    — pynput: Right Option PTT, ⌃⌥S speak
├── inject.py     — inject_text() paste path, type_text() keystroke path
├── selection.py  — synthesized ⌘C with clipboard snapshot/restore
└── state.py      — config (~/.config/codewithvoice/config.json)
docs/             — MkDocs Material site, deployed by .github/workflows/docs.yml
```

## Canonical commands

```bash
make install   # uv sync
make run       # run the app (menu bar shows ⏳ then ●)
make smoke     # in-process ASR + TTS engine test (no desktop session needed)
make docs      # serve the docs site locally
```

There is no test suite or linter configured (`uvx ruff check src/` passes; keep
it that way). Verify changes with `make smoke`; for `streaming.py` changes,
drive `StreamingTranscriber` with a fake recorder whose `snapshot()` returns a
growing slice of decoded sample audio.

## Rules

- **NEVER** retract typed text in the live-typing path — committed words are final by design; fix commit *quality* (holdback, agreement, run guard), not output.
- **NEVER** trust LocalAgreement alone to reject whisper hallucinations — silence loops ("cooling cooling…") are self-consistent across passes. Keep all three guards: segment filter in `engine/asr.py`, `MAX_WORD_RUN` in `streaming.py`, RMS silence skip in the worker loop.
- **ALWAYS** hold `app.py`'s `_engine_lock` around any whisper/Kokoro call; the engines are not concurrency-safe under MPS/MLX.
- **ALWAYS** mutate the menu-bar UI on the main thread via `AppHelper.callAfter` (see `_set_title`).
- **ALWAYS** update the matching page under `docs/` (reference for behavior, guides for workflows) in the same change as a user-visible code change.
- **DO NOT** raise the 29.5 s recording cap without windowing the streaming buffer — each streaming pass re-transcribes from sample 0, so cost grows with clip length.
- **DO NOT** add models that won't fit comfortably in RAM next to normal apps; a 10 GB Gemma-as-ASR experiment thrashed 32 GB into 44 GB of swap. Memory-pressure check: if the process RSS ≪ VSZ, the model is paged out — free RAM, don't tune inference.
- pyobjc packages in `pyproject.toml` are lowercase (`pyobjc-framework-cocoa`); `AppKit` ships inside `pyobjc-framework-cocoa`.

## Common tasks

### Changing live-typing behavior
1. Algorithm lives in `streaming.py` (`HOLDBACK_WORDS`, `MAX_WORD_RUN`, `interval`).
2. Replicate any reported garbled output as an input-sequence unit case first (feed hypotheses through `_ingest`/`finalize`), then change the algorithm.
3. Wiring is in `app.py` `_on_ptt_down` / `_asr_and_inject`; the paste fallback path must keep working when nothing was committed.

### Swapping the ASR model
1. Change `MODEL_REPO` in `engine/asr.py` (e.g. `mlx-community/whisper-medium-mlx-q4` for better accuracy at ~1 GB).
2. Run `make smoke`; check the `[asr] … rtf=…` log line stays well above 1× realtime.

### Manual end-to-end verification (needs desktop session + permissions)
1. `make run`, wait for `●`.
2. TextEdit → hold Right Option, speak ≥6 s, release: words appear during speech (bursts), tail on release, `✓` flash.
3. Select text → ⌃⌥S speaks it. Clipboard contents must survive both flows.

## Permissions gotcha

Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring grants attach to the *terminal
app* that launched the bar. Hotkey listeners read grants at startup — relaunch
after granting. Secure fields reject synthesized input by design.
